\section{Introduction to Classical Mechanics}

In Classical Mechanis (CM) time and space are treated as two distinct concepts.
Events are identified by their position in some frame of reference, represented
by a vector \(\vv{r}\), and the time at which they occur, represented by a
scalar \(t\).

The simplest formulation of CM can be summarised in three laws and is based on
the concept of \textbf{force}. A force \(\vv{F}\) is a vector quantity
representing an interaction between two bodies. This formulation is (unduly)
credited to Newton because it was first published as a unified theory in the
\emph{Principia}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{N\arabic*},start=0]
  \item \label{law::N0} \textbf{Principle of Superposition:} the net force
  on a body is the vector sum of the individual forces acting on it.
  \item \label{law::N1} \textbf{Law of Inertia:} an inertial frame of reference
  is one where, in the absence of external interactions, bodies are in uniform
  linear motion.
  \item \label{law::N2} \textbf{Law of Acceleration:} in an inertial frame of
  reference the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force
  acting on it.
  \item \label{law::N3} \textbf{Law of Reaction:} when a body exerts a force on
  another it is subject to a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
  produced by the second body.
\end{enumerate}

Law \ref{law::N2} can be used to introduce the concept of \textbf{inertial mass}
\(m\), which is taken as the proportionality constant between force and
acceleration. The law can then be stated with the following equation.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:N2}
    \vv{F} = m \, \vv{\ddot{r}}\tag{N2}
\end{equation}

\section{Galilean gravity}

The simplest theory of gravity in our possession is due to Galileo and simply
states that acceleration due to gravity is constant, regardless of the size,
velocity or position of a body. In hindsight, Galilean gravity can be thought of
as gravity in the limit where Earth is and indefinitely extended plane with a
uniform mass distribution.
%
\[\vv{\ddot{r}} = \vv{g}\]
%
This theory, although excessively simple, lays the foundation of the
\textbf{Equivalence Principle}. One of many possible statements of this
principle is that the trajectory of a body subject to gravity is only dependent
upon its initial position and velocity. This principle is backed up by all
experimental evidence to date.
