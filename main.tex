\section{Introduction to Classical Mechanics}

In Classical Mechanis (CM) time and space are treated as two distinct concepts.
Events are identified by their position in some frame of reference, represented by a vector \(\vv{r}\), and the time at which they occur, represented by a scalar \(t\).

The simplest formulation of CM can be summarised in three laws and is based on the concept of \textbf{force}.
A force \(\vv{F}\) is a vector quantity representing an interaction between two bodies.
This formulation is (unduly) credited to Newton because it was first published as a unified theory in the \emph{Principia}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{N\arabic*},start=0]
  \item \label{law::N0} \textbf{Principle of Superposition:} the net force on a body is the vector sum of the individual forces acting on it.
  \item \label{law::N1} \textbf{Law of Inertia:} an inertial frame of reference is one where, in the absence of external interactions, bodies are in uniform linear motion.
  \item \label{law::N2} \textbf{Law of Acceleration:} in an inertial frame of reference the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force acting on it.
  \item \label{law::N3} \textbf{Law of Reaction:} when a body exerts a force on another it is subject to a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction produced by the second body.
\end{enumerate}

Law \ref{law::N2} can be used to introduce the concept of \textbf{inertial mass} \(m\), which is taken as the proportionality constant between force and acceleration.
The law can then be stated with the following equation.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:N2}
    \vv{F} = m \, \vv{\ddot{r}}\tag{N2}
\end{equation}

\section{Galilean gravity}

The simplest theory of gravity in our possession is due to Galileo and simply states that acceleration due to gravity is constant, regardless of the size, velocity or position of a body.
In hindsight, Galilean gravity can be thought of as gravity in the limit where Earth is and indefinitely extended plane with a uniform mass distribution.
%
\[\vv{\ddot{r}} = \vv{g}\]
%
This theory, although excessively simple, lays the foundation of a fundamental principle.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{EP}]
  \item \label{law::EP} \textbf{Equivalence Principle:} all bodies subject to a gravitational field will undergo the same acceleration if they are located at the same coordinates in space and time.
\end{enumerate}

This principle is backed up by all experimental evidence to date.

\section{Hookean gravity}

Generally credited to Newton, most of the fundamental work on this theory was actually due to Hooke.
The basic principle of the theory is that every body exerts a gravitational force on every other body.
This force pulls the objects towards each other and its intensity is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item directly proportional to the \textbf{active gravitational mass} \(\widetilde{m}^{\text{(a)}}\) of the body exerting the force,
  \item directly proportional to the \textbf{passive gravitational mass} \(\widetilde{m}^{\text{(p)}}\) of the body subject to the force,
  \item inversely proportional to the square of their distance.
\end{itemize}

This can be expressed as the following formula
%
\[F_{1 \to 2} = G \, \frac{\widetilde{m}_1^{\text{(a)}}
\widetilde{m}_2^{\text{(p)}}}{\norm{\vv{r}_{1 \to 2}}^2}\]
%
where \(F_{1 \to 2}\) is the intensity of the force exerted by body 1 on body 2 and \(\vv{r}_{1 \to 2} = \vv{r}_{2} - \vv{r}_1\) is the relative position of body 2 with respect to body 1.
\(G\) is a universal constant know as the \textbf{gravitational constant} or \textbf{Cavendish constant}.

By applying \ref{law::N3} we require that \(F_{1 \to 2} = F_{2 \to 1}\).
This can be manipulated to obtain that the ratio between active and passive gravitational mass must be constant for all bodies.
%
\[\frac{\widetilde{m}_1^{\text{(a)}}}{\widetilde{m}_1^{\text{(p)}}} =
\frac{\widetilde{m}_2^{\text{(a)}}}{\widetilde{m}_2^{\text{(p)}}}\]
%
Therefore we can take this constant to be unity and drop the distinction between the two types of gravitational mass.
Our law then becomes
%
\[F_{1 \to 2} = G \, \frac{\widetilde{m}_1\widetilde{m}_2}
{\norm{\vv{r}_{1 \to 2}}^2}\]
%
We follow up by applying \ref{law::N2} to the second body and finding its
acceleration \(\ddot{r}_2\).
%
\[\ddot{r}_2 = G \, \frac{\widetilde{m}_1}{R^2} \frac{\widetilde{m}_2}{m_2}\]
%
By virtue of \ref{law::EP} this acceleration must not depend upon any properties of the body itself, the ratio between gravitational and inertial mass must therefore be a constant.
This constant can also be taken to be unity, removing any and all practical distinctions between the various types of mass.

We thus obtain the \textbf{Law of Universal Gravitation} in its most commonly used forms.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:N2}
    F_{1 \to 2} = G \, \frac{m_1 m_2}{\norm{\vv{r}_{1 \to 2}}^2}
    \qquad
    \vv{F}_{1 \to 2} = - G \, \frac{m_1 m_2}{\norm{\vv{r}_{1 \to 2}}^3}  \, \vv{r}_{1 \to 2}
    \tag{UG}
\end{equation}
